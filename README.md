# motorcycle-repair-mysql
This project is a relational database designed for a motorcycle repair shop, built using MySQL in XAMPP. It manages customer details, motorcycle service records, inventory, and mechanics to streamline the repair process. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is created using Crowâ€™s Foot notation to clearly define relationships between entities.
